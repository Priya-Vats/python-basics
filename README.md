# Python Learning & Practice Portfolio 🐍

## Overview

This repository documents my structured journey of learning **Python programming from fundamentals to object-oriented concepts**. It contains concept-wise practice files, problem-solving exercises, and beginner-level projects created using **VS Code** with a hands-on approach.

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate:

* Strong understanding of Python fundamentals
* Consistent practice and clean coding habits
* Ability to structure and document learning professionally

---

## Skills & Concepts Demonstrated

* **Core Python**: syntax, variables, data types
* **Control Flow**: conditional statements, loops
* **Functions**: arguments, default parameters, recursion
* **Data Structures**:

  * Strings
  * Lists
  * Tuples
  * Dictionaries
  * Sets
* **File Handling**: reading and writing files
* **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**:

  * Classes and objects
  * Methods and constructors
* **Problem Solving**: chapter-wise practice questions
* **Version Control**: Git & GitHub
